# Working with Mike - Everything You Wanted to Know But Were Afraid to Ask

This document is a chance to share with you how I work and how you can best work with me. 

## About Me

As an R&D Leader in earth observation technology, I am fundamentally driven by:
* Solving problems
* Understanding how things work and making them better
* Helping everyone to see and appreciate the value of what we make
* Being part of a winning team
* Making the world a better place

I added those last two parts because I've found it's very possible to do a lot of the first three things while failing to turn our work into something positive for the world and for the company I work at. It's important to me that what we do connects strongly with making our accomplishments "real" (someone will use it), making our business succeed (someone will buy it) and making a positive change (something was made better because of what we did).

I love what we do and feel inspired by working with amazing people. I've never felt like the "smartest guy in the room" (just the opposite, usually). I genuinely enjoy working with people and seeing the different skills that people can bring. I feel like I can appreciate a wide variety of perspectives and see the good qualities in anyone. 

I'm an introvert (I think), but I love talking with people. I just need time to recharge the social battery after doing so. I don't think most people would know this about me, I try to hide it.


## Operating Approach

* It's important to me to stay connected with my teams and to get a better-than-surface-level understanding of the initiatives we have and their progress
* I like to meet 1:1 with my direct-reports weekly and appreciate when they come prepared to discuss their concerns, what's exciting them right now, where they need help and what their key activities have been
  - Often times our discussions lead to actions and I like to make sure any actions are explicit and clearly assigned to one of us
* In order to preserve space in my calendar, I prefer to meet 1:1 with others in my team on a less frequent or as-needed basis, and I rely on them to take the initative to set these up when requested
  - I am always happy to have those meetings though! Please ask for them whenever you'd like to talk

## Management Style
  
## How I Communicate

### Ways to reach me (in priority order):

1. Slack
2. Text/WhatsApp (number is in slack)
3. Email

### Please reach out

Please always reach out to me on Slack. I would rather you send me a ping than not. I prefer more communication than less. And it is not a bother. Use my office hours for more verbal discussions.

### How to communicate challenges

If you have a problem, bring it. But come with ideas about solutions or information that will help me to help you decide something.

### Feedback

Feedback is important. Please give it, especially constructive and not anonymous. I will not be mad or upset with you, nor will I retaliate or seek retribution. I take all feedback to heart and will typically think on it for a while and try to correct or take relevant action.

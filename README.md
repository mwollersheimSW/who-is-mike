# Working with Mike - Everything You Wanted to Know But Were Afraid to Ask

This document is a chance to share with you how I work and how you can best work with me. 

## About Me

As a leader in R&D, I am fundamentally driven by:
* Solving business problems by creating innovative solutions
* Understanding how things work and making them better and more efficient
* Helping everyone to see, appreciate, and tap into the value of what we create
* Being part of a winning team
* Making the world a better place

I added the last two because I've found it's very possible to do a lot of the first three things while failing to turn our work into something positive for the world and for the company I work at. It's important to me that what we do connects strongly with making our accomplishments "real" (someone will use it), making our business succeed (someone will buy it) and making a positive change (something was made better because of what we did).

I love what we do and feel inspired by working with amazing people. I genuinely enjoy working with others and seeing the different skills that they bring. I appreciate a wide variety of perspectives and see good qualities in everyone. I never want to be the "smartest person in the room" (just the opposite would be ideal ;)). I'm ambitious, motivated to succeed and confident that we can overcome any obstacle if we keep the right attitude.

## Operating Approach

### Meetings and 1:1s
* It's important to me to stay connected with my teams and to get a better-than-surface-level understanding of the initiatives we have and their progress
* I like to meet 1:1 with my direct-reports weekly and appreciate when they come prepared to discuss their concerns, what's exciting them right now, where they need help and what their key activities have been
  - Often times our discussions lead to actions and I like to make sure any actions are explicit and clearly assigned to one of us
* In order to preserve space in my calendar, I prefer my other 1:1 to be on a less frequent or as-needed basis, and I rely on others to take the initative to set these up when requested
  - I am always happy to have those meetings though! Please ask for them whenever you'd like to talk
* Biweekly Team / Product Meetings as appropriate
  - I find a biweekly cadence to be perfect for catching up on the progress of any ongoing Research or Product Development
  - For highly time-critical activities, daily (or more frequent) updates are important so we make sure to stay aligned the whole way

## Management Style

### Hands-off - I trust you and want to enable you
* I’m not a micromanager, and I won’t sweat the details unless I think things are off track.
  - If I do, I’ll tell you my concern, and we can work together to communicate better and put things back on track.
  - That said, when I’m new to a project or team, I often get into the work alongside people so I can be a better leader.
  - I will get involved in details and be more hands-on early in a new initiative, so just be warned about that.

* I expect you are making decisions without me.
  - If you come to me, I’ll usually first ask “What do you think you should do?", and help you think through that course of action.
  - If there is a big decision brewing, I’d love to know about it, and I’m always here to talk it out.
  - I like to be informed and to know what’s going on with you and your team.
  - I value proactivity and don't want to be a roadblock for you.
  - My aim is to give you a good map to equip you for your journey. Please tell me when the map has been lost ;)
  - I can also be your shield when you need it to block interruptions and requests for your time that risk stealing your focus


### How Much Information?
* I tend to be an "open book" and I find collaboration works best when everyone is informed and has context
  - I'll aim to give you as much strategic context and transparency as I can so you can see the big picture
* I appreciate when you are a good filter to help me know what's happening with your team members
  - Anything that is impacting morale or effective working relationships is critical for me to know
  - Routine things and issues you are comfortable to resolve on your own don't need to be shared. I fully trust you to handle those
  - Sharing Wins and Key accomplishments is always welcome. It's important to celebrate these, raise awareness and share about team's successes

### How I Make Decisions:

* I like facts and data. Decisions are MUCH easier to make when there are hard data points provided for consideration
  - I may need a bit of time to properly consider something, so I can't always give an immediate decision. Please bring me the facts and I will come back to you with an answer
  - I ask a lot of questions to help me understand better, so please be patient with me if I pepper you. These are part of my process
* I value a community perspective
  - I think it's important to poll the audience and get input from all stakeholders before deciding something
  - After the facts are in, I will then make a decision based on all facts, data and viewpoints I have

  
## How I Communicate

I'm an introvert (I think), but I love talking with people. Hearing from you is a delight and I will always enjoy hearing about how you are doing, even personally. Since I work asynchronously with most people, I rely heavily on the written word for a lot of my communication. Slack is my weapon of choice. I often wake up to a lot of messages, so apologies if my responses are a bit delayed. If you have something urgent to discuss, you can get my attention by tagging me in a post. I will see those first. If it's REALLY critical and urgent, a tagged DM with the message "FOO BAR" is a bat signal I will see right away. Please use it sparingly ;)

That said, if we have a lot to talk about and if there are multiple people involved, jumping on a Zoom call likely saves us all a fair bit of time.

About FYI's: I like these. If you think there is something I would like to be in the loop on, but doesn't need my input, feel free to copy me on an email, point me to a slack thread or just give me an FYI update. I ask that these are clearly tagged as FYIs though, so I don't re-read a few times wonder where my input was needed ;).  

I'm patient, compassionate and calm, even in serious or difficult conversations. I won't ever yell or get angry, but will seek a rational and peaceful solution to everything. 

I like vulnerability. If you ask me about my family or how things are going, I will probably be very open about it. I think vulnerability creates trust and enables us to establish a bond. I give it pretty easily, but I understand and respect that you might not be comfortable with sharing about yourself. That's totally OK! No obligation to reciprocate and I can keep it all business if you're most comfortable with that.

Emojis Please! I am a little bit insecure and a tad neurotic, but most of all, I really want to know if my messages connected. Not everything I write needs a reply, but if you can take a few seconds to throw down an emoji on a Slack message from me, just to say "OK", that little action helps me more than you could know. It tells me the message didn't just go out into the ether and it acknowledges that you have at least seen it. 

### Ways to reach me (in priority order):

1. Slack
2. Zoom / Meeting
3. Email
4. Text
5. Phone Call (OMG, don't you know how to text? ;) )

### Please reach out

Please always reach out to me on Slack. I would rather you send me a ping than not. I prefer more communication than less. And it is not a bother. 

### Did he forget about me?

Maybe! I hope not, but if you are expecting a reply for more than a few days then something is definitely wrong. I really appreciate nudges and reminders in that case. If I'm on it and just need more time, no harm done! But if I accidentally missed your message or failed to save it, it will help us both if you gave me a bit of a poke to make sure it didn't slip. 

### How to communicate challenges you are facing

If you have a problem, please bring it to me. I don't want you to suffer in silence and I can't help with what I don't know about. It breaks my heart whenever I learn that someone was struggling with something and didn't know if they should reach out about it. Channel your inner Nike and Just Do It! I love when you come with your own suggestion or possible solutions, but I also know you might not have any. Don't let that stop you from reaching out.  

### Feedback

Feedback is important to me. Please do give it. I will not be mad or upset with you and I think a healthy environment is one where people can say what they really feel, or even vent when needed. I take all feedback to heart and will typically think on it for a while and try to correct or take relevant action.

# Working with Mike - Everything You Wanted to Know But Were Afraid to Ask

This document is a chance to share with you how I work and how you can best work with me. 

## About Me

As a leader in R&D, I am fundamentally driven by:
* Solving problems
* Understanding how things work and making them better
* Helping everyone to see and appreciate the value of what we make
* Being part of a winning team
* Making the world a better place

I added the last two because I've found it's very possible to do a lot of the first three things while failing to turn our work into something positive for the world and for the company I work at. It's important to me that what we do connects strongly with making our accomplishments "real" (someone will use it), making our business succeed (someone will buy it) and making a positive change (something was made better because of what we did).

I love what we do and feel inspired by working with amazing people. I genuinely enjoy working with people and seeing the different skills that people can bring. I feel like I can appreciate a wide variety of perspectives and see the good qualities in anyone. In that way, I've never felt like the "smartest guy in the room" (just the opposite, usually). 

## Operating Approach

### Meetings and 1:1s
* It's important to me to stay connected with my teams and to get a better-than-surface-level understanding of the initiatives we have and their progress
* I like to meet 1:1 with my direct-reports weekly and appreciate when they come prepared to discuss their concerns, what's exciting them right now, where they need help and what their key activities have been
  - Often times our discussions lead to actions and I like to make sure any actions are explicit and clearly assigned to one of us
* In order to preserve space in my calendar, I prefer my other 1:1 to be on a less frequent or as-needed basis, and I rely on others to take the initative to set these up when requested
  - I am always happy to have those meetings though! Please ask for them whenever you'd like to talk
* Biweekly Team / Product Meetings as appropriate
  - I find a biweekly cadence to be perfect for catching up on the progress of any Research or Product Development
  - Exceptions to this would be if there is time-critical activity or customer response, in which case we probably need to check in each day or more often

## Management Style

* I tend to be an "open book" and I find collaboration works best when everyone is informed and has context
  - I'll aim to give you as much strategic context and transparency as I can
* I want you to be a good filter to help me know about what's happening with your team members
  - Anything that is impacting morale or effective working relationships is always helpful context (signal)
  - More routine things and issues you are comfortable to resolve on your own doesn't need to be shared (noise)
  - Wins and Key accomplishments always count as "signal" in my book ;)
* I want you to feel trusted and empowered to take initiative and make decisions
  - I value proactivity and don't want to be a roadblock
* I will attempt to be your shield when you need it to block interruptions and defocusing inquires from sales, PMs and others where possible
* I like facts and data. Decisions are always MUCH easier to make when there are hard data points provided for consideration
  - I most often need a bit of time to properly consider something, so an immediate decision is unlikely. Please bring me the facts and I will come back to you with
  - I ask a lot of questions to help me understand better, so please be patient with me if I pepper you. These are part of my process


  
## How I Communicate

I'm an introvert (I think), but I love talking with people. I just need time to recharge the social battery after doing so. Since I work asynchronously with most people, I rely pretty heavily on the written word for a lot my communication. For this, Slack is my weapon of choice. 

That said, if we have a lot to talk about and if there are multiple people involved, jumping on a Zoom call likely saves us all a fair bit of time.

I'm patient, compassionate and calm, even in serious or difficult conversations. I won't ever yell or get angry, but will seek a rational and peaceful solution to everything.


### Ways to reach me (in priority order):

1. Slack
2. Zoom / Meeting
3. Email
4. Text / Phone

### Please reach out

Please always reach out to me on Slack. I would rather you send me a ping than not. I prefer more communication than less. And it is not a bother. 

### How to communicate challenges

If you have a problem, bring it. But come with ideas about solutions or information that will help me to help you decide something.

### Feedback

Feedback is important. Please give it, especially constructive and not anonymous. I will not be mad or upset with you, nor will I retaliate or seek retribution. I take all feedback to heart and will typically think on it for a while and try to correct or take relevant action.
